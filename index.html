                <p class="align-para">It is firmly believed that an intriguing team name is highly possible to catch the attention of the potential employers. If I were opted to choose, I would love to call our team “The Ant Team”. Initially, ants are considered as an incredible creature as they have such magnificent power. Some researches presents that they are able to carry between 10 and 50 times their own body weight. Therefore, I want to indicate that with 100% effort and strength, my team will carry out all the tasks no matter how complexed or challeging they are. Another considerable point to mention is that my desired team’s name is also inspired by the film named “The Ant Man”. In that film, there is a super hero who can shrink himself to the size of an insect with a special suit. With the assistance of it, he is capable of promptly infiltrating to any building without getting caught. From my perspective, although our team does not have any special suit like “Ant Man”, we still manage to infiltrate to every detail in our project in order to gain a better insight into every problem then improve them effectively.</p>

            <div class="team-profile">
                <h2 class="bold-title">Team Profile</h2>
                <p class="align-para">Initially, there was just 3 people in our team as unfortunately, the outbreak of Covid-19 in Ho Chi Minh city forced RMIT University to launch online classes. Therefore, it was inconvinient for us to make new friends and find a compatible teammate. Then, thanks to the tutorial class in week 6, our team finally assembled and could move to the next step. From our team, my MBTI result is ENTJ, two of my teammate are ENFP and the other is ISFJ. It is obvious that communication sometimes can present as a big challenge between any two invididuals. However, with 3 extroverts in our team, it creates a comfortable environment for everyone to express their ideas and have a dicussion about them. Undoubtedly, while ENTJ and ISTJ are both judging personalities which always revovle around practical aspects, organized and goal-orientated plan, ENFP friends will provide us more chances to get access to many creative spontaneous ideas which may be helpful in some unexpected circumstances. In the working environment, all of us are described as creative, focused, organized problem-solvers but in different ways. To be more specific, working as a team provides us a great opportunity to learn each other’s strengths and improve our drawbacks. ENTJ and ISTJ tend to more concentrate on rational mindset and a drive to achieve compared to the emotional decision-making and a flexible approach of ÈNFP. As a team, we can encourage other teammates to commit to the long-term milestones, goals or considering other’s feeling. Moreover, ENFPs is known to be proficient in adapting and improvising to changes, which is likely to benefit ISFJ and ENTJ who like to follow plans. Another remarkable point to mention is the fact that all of us have the same learning type which is visual learner. There is no doubt that with the same learning patterns, it is likely to facilitate our cooperation and researching process as we can share our sources and methods. As the result indicated, reading, seeing pictures or visualizing information are considered as one of the most effective approaches to comprehend knowledge clearly and remember. </p>

Also, I acknowledged that it can be used as an effective tool to collaborate with teammates in the group project as I allow us to keep track of every change and each other’s work. First of all, I create a GitHub repository called “IT World” to push my report file in HTML file, CSS file and additional image to it. After that, I use GitHub page in the setting in order to have my website link. Here are the like to my website and my GitHub repository:</p>

            <hr>
            <div class="overview">
                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p class="align-para">Initially, my project would be introduced as a user-friendly mobile application which revolves around farming and planting management. It will contain 3 remarkable features namely diagnose & treatment, calculator and automatic operation. Specifically, the first considerable function is that with just a few clicks on your smartphone to provide photos, the data will be processed and analyzed then print out the encountered problems associated with the offered treatments after just a few seconds. Therefore, it can be considered as a productive assistant of everyone whether they are professionals or normal users. In addition, the calculation works as a tool measuring the farming practices, preventive and fertilizer process after collecting all the necessary data. Moreover, my application would love to offer such a convinient feature, specially for large-scale farming or planting, which is to control all the machines with your smartphone. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="motivation">
                <h4>Motivation</h4>
                <p class="align-para">It is well-known that agriculture has been one of the leading industries in Vietnam for many years which creates a sustainable revenue for farmers by exporting agricultural products. Although there are some scientific breakthroughs in agriculture area, applying technology to farming practice is still a big challenge for local farmers who usually depend on their experience. Moreover, most of the tasks have to executed manually as they are not familiar with utilizing automatic system. Therefore, my application tends to solve these problems as it offers more logical, accurate assumption and convenient management. Subsequently, for normal users who just take planting as leisure activity, they are likely to encounter issues when unexpected disease or pest appears as they do not acquire the sufficient amount of knowledge to diagnose. Then, my project is built in order to help them tackle the problems promptly and effectively. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p class="align-para">It is necessary to share that my intention is to build this application as a mobile app as it is the most convenient approach to get access to every type of user. The first feature to mention is the diagnose & treatment. It is built with the aim to support users whenever they feel confused and worried about the condition of their plants, crops. In this section, the application will ask for 3 photos of an infected crop or plan to provide data for AI-based image recognition which has been shown to be a practical option for detecting plant problems. Subsequently, the provided photos will be processed and compared with the prior images which are affected by insects, diseases or nutrient deficiency problems in the database. After that, the description of the problem will be presented associated with some recommendations for recovery for users to gain a better insight into their plant. By this way, they will gain some experience to avoid repeating the same problem in the future and know the solutions to help the surroundings. The results from the field tests will be combined into the training data for the statistical algorithms used to program the AI system to learn and improve. It means that the system will automatically learn from the past test results so as to improve the evaluation quality and increase the accuracy. Another considerable function to point out is the calculation. It will request the information about the type of crop, planting area, user’s location in order to analyze. After calculating, the appropriate number of plants needed for an area, the distance between every plant will be suggested for users to decide the quantity of plants. Moreover, suitable fertilizer, preventive methods, fertilizer period are also illustrated to exclude the likelihood of the ill crop. Interestingly, acquiring the user’s location helps the system to get the data about the next date’s weather and then suggest the appropriate watering period and best farming practices. Utimately, automatic operation applying Iot is the last feature of this application. Depending on different purposes, the users need to implant different sensors to provide the recent conditions. My application will mainly focus on watering and lighting system. It is known that using lighting bulb at night for fruit, especially dragon fruit, will boost the yields as it tends to shorten the flowering period and harvest faster. Also, watering with appropriate water volume is a crucial key for growing plants since it has a direct impact on plants. Lack of water or excessive water content can make plants dry or rotten. Through the app, users can activate the system after considering the condition and receive the notification when the task is down. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tools-and-technology">
                <h4>Tools and Technology</h4>
                <p class="align-para">
                    To be honest, my project follows the AI-based banana disease and pest detection system (Selvaraj et al., 2019) but my model wishes to apply on a wider range of crops. To make this project successful, for diagnose & treatment, a large database with different crops and diseases is a must as the project needs to have the relevant sources to compare to the provided photos from users. Therefore, the PlantVillage (https://plantvillage.psu.edu/plants) platform which contains over 50 000 images is such a desirable library and I would love to utilize it for this project. However, as most of the images are taken on the plain background which can lead to inaccurate outcome, diseased images taken from different environments, resolutions, light conditions are needed in order to build a robust and practical model. Building a deep learning system is needed so as to generate a framework for digital image processing and object detection with greater accuracy. At the first place, all pictures will be categorized into 2 groups namely healthy plants and infected plants. After that, the latter is expected to undergo the data labeling process and the infected areas will be annotated. Then CNN architecture, which is the most famous and commonly employed algorithm, will be applied to train the models. Faster RCNN with ResNet50 and Inception V2 is chosen for the stage of object detector while MobileNetV1 is selected for detection models in TensorFlow. Python deep learning library called TensorFlow is applied to train these models. These models then will be re-trained utilizing the transfer learning approach from the pre-trained versions.
                    <br> In addition, weather data from The Weather Channel (https://weather.com/?Goto=Redirected) is considered as one of the most significant factors helping to build precise planting strategy. Finally, as I have mentioned above, a sensor is required to be implemented to detect the recent conditions for users to activate the system through their phones.  
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="skill-required">
                <h4>Skill Required</h4>
                <p class="align-para">Building a deep learning system is needed so as to generate a framework for digital image processing and object detection with greater accuracy. After collecting a dataset collection, the images are expected to undergo the data labeling process and the infected areas will be annotated. After that, CNN architecture, which is the most famous and commonly employed algorithm, will be applied to train the models. The possibility of completing this project is high as there are many advanced supportive software and tools. For example, the developers can utilize LabelImg software for image tagging process and to train the models, a python deep learning library named TensorFlow turns out to be the effective option.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="outcome">
                <h4>Outcome</h4>
                <p class="align-para">I believed that my application is highly possible to become a great assistant of users, especially the farmers. The user interface is planned to be designed in a straightforward, convenient approach to interact with. Hopefully, this application would exclude the likelihood of unexpected rotten crops, which may optimize the productivity and boost the yields. Moreover, automating lighting or watering systems helps farmers to reduce the labor, costs and increase efficiency. Therefore, by installing technology into agriculture, I believe it will bring the brighter future to this traditional industry.</p>

            <h2 class="bold-title">Feedback</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="align-para">To gain an objective point of view, I have invited my classmates to give me some feedbacks about my project. The first one’s name is Khoi Vo whose student ID is s3891987. In general, he suggests that I should only focus on the large-scale planting as all the functions are effectively designed for it. After reconsidering his idea, I agree with him. To be honest, I was too ambitious as I want to satisfy and serve every type of users ranging from non-professional users to the proficient ones. Moreover, from his point of view, he thought that 3 pictures are not enough for the system to compare and analyze. Therefore, it may lead to wrong result or the system fails to identify the patterns. The most important thing that he emphasizes is that the data library is needed to be broadened. 50 000 pictures are not enough to cover all kinds of plants as the number of plants is too large and they may modify their features according to different living environments. Also, he highly recommends to print out some friendly statement if the application fails to search for the answers such as “Please try again”, “Please try another shooting angle” so as to enhance the user experience. Next, the other classmate that I choose is Vo Thanh Hoang Anh with the Student ID s3891714. Initially, she believes that the idea of my project is quite fascinating but not novel. It’s just a combination of existing technologies and applications of AI and IoT and she expects some innovative ideas that has not appeared ever before. Subsequently, the next point she suggests is quite similar to Khoi which is enhance the number of pictures in the data library. She explains that every plant requires about 800-1000 pictures in order to come up with the correct result. Therefore, additional datasets are the must and they should be categorized based on their geographic areas. Finally, the UI/UX design must be straightforward and friendly as the targeted users, who are mainly farmers, are not familiar with modern technology and the elaborate interface is highly possible to make them confused. To be honest, I found these advices extremely intriguing and motivative. In the future, I am going to optimize my application for large-scale farming and planting only because my built functions suit them most. Moreover, the dataset obviously needs to be enlarged and I will keep researching with the aim to figure out the suitable ones.</p>

            <h2 class="bold-title">IT Technology</h2>
            <hr>
            <h4>a)	Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning</h4>
            <p class="align-para">It is needed to mention that my project mainly focuses on Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning and IoT. Initially, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to describe the simulation of human intelligence in machines which make it perform like humans while Machine Learning (ML) is a type of AI that that allows software application to be more precise at predicting the results without being programmed previously. Specifically, it will utilize the historical data and results to predict more accurate values after learning and improving. It is firmly believed that AI/ML will be the foundation of future scientific breakthroughs as it is excessively effective. At the moment, it is applied into many industries such as robotics, healthcare, social media,… There is no doubt that the popularity of using AI in robotics has accelerated at the startling pace and aroused much public interest in the recent time. Nowadays, robotics are not just the programmed objects but also are capable of thinking in a limited capacity and solving the problems. One of the most vivid examples to present is the famous social robot named Sophia who has participated in many interviews. From the reports, it is indicated that Sophia is able to imitate human gestures, facial expressions and answer certain questions to perform basic conversations on predefined topics. The ultimate vision of Sophia’s inventors is to generate a suitable companion for nursing homes or helping people at public areas. In the foreseeable future, specifically in the next 3 years, I guess that self-driving cars will be the next milestone of STEM industry. It is described as an autonomous vehicle which is installed a great number of sensors to analyze the environment and move safely without the influence of human. Apart form sensors, self-driving cars are equipped with a great number of supportive tools namely radar, lidar, sonar, GPS,…  However, AI/ML unit is undoubtfully the most important part leading to the safe self-driving cars as the cars need to “learn” how to follow the rules such as stopping when the traffic light turns red and running when the traffic light turns green. At the moment, many major auto manufacturers, especially young tech and startups, have been working on their own self-driving vehicles. Most of them aim to research more thoroughly into the use in public transportation so as to optimize the personal needs and ride sharing. However, they mainly focus on the personal and transportation service such as taxes, buses and neglect the huge potential in logistic industry. Firstly, with the serious status of Covid-19 pandamic, every citizen is suggested to stay at home as going out will put them in danger. However, the need for food and basic supplies still have to be refilled after 2-3 days. As a result, self-driving grocery delivery should be taken into serious account of many manufactures, which can pick items through their app and have them delivered along. To ensure the safe decisions on the road, it is equipped with AI software, sensors, real-time cameras and plenty of test miles. One remarkbale point to mention is that with AI software, the machine can learn and adapt to the favorable options from the users, which can reduce a great number of waiting time. Another considerable point to mention is the delivery systems such as self-driving trucks or ships. It is well-known that every year, there is a great number of traffic accidents which is caused by night driving or severe environment outside the sea. As a result, generating autonomous delivery vehicles is likely to exlucde the likelihood of excessive human and material loss. In order to come up with safer, cheaper, more comfortable method, Deep Learning models are applied to train the vehicles to perform complex tasks such as dectecting and presuming ground objects and road structures, predicting the behaviors of surrounding vehicles. </p>
            <p class="align-para">One apparent point to mention about the impact of AI is that it can modify nearly all of the indutries into smarter version of themselves. At the moment, it is irrefutable that AI assistants have been widespreaded among everybody’s lives, which can mention Siri on Iphone or Google Asisstant or Alexa. From my own perspective, I believe that AI assistants is expected to alter and create a new habit for many users and that is to give orders by verbal communication. For example, for Apple users, by saying “Hey Siri”, they can ask Siri to set a reminder, alarm for them or ask for the recent weather without getting access to the relevant apps. Morover, house is getting smarter and smarter day by day. To be more specific, Roomba (iRobot), which is much smarter robotic robotic vacuum, can be taken as a vivid example. It utilizes AI to scan room size, detect obstacles and adapt the most efficient routes for cleaning. One more remarkable feature is that AI is deploying as a critical part of modern military science. In the fierce and severe environment such as complex combat, AI techniques are implemented with the aim to enhace the accuracy of target recognition. It allows the force to acquire the forecasts about enemy behavior or environmental conditions. In the next 10 years, it is anticipated that monotonous jobs, especially accountants, will be replaced by AI as it requires repetitive calculations and keep records. Firstly, robotic automation will take over all the routine tasks such as payrolls, tax handling, audits in the shorter amount of time with higher accuracy. Moreover, by taking and learning from the past test results, AI machines can devise a more organized, effective strategy to perform tasks. Therefore, I assume that the repetitive and monotonous jobs will be altered and replaced by AI robots in the foreseeable future.</p>
            <p class="align-para">In my daily life, my life will be much more comfortable thanks to the appearance of AI technology. One supporting idea suggests that social media networks utilize AI in order to advertise more effectively to users. By getting data from my interactions with every posts on their platfroms, AI technology is set up to analyze and sort out all the relevant contents so as to personalize my experience. Another considerable point to mention is that digital assistant will be a compatible companion in my everyday life. It is strongly concluded that the popularity of digital assistants has been accrelerating at the startling pace in the recent time. Obviously, you can use them for a wide variety of purposes namely message dictation, internet searches, alarms and reminders,… From my own experience, I usually use Siri for setting up alarm for morning exercise or reminders to recall me about some important upcoming tasks. One more interesting thing is that if I told a mistake in responding to a request of Siri, it will learn and improve to avoid repeating the error. To be honest, I have to admit that it makes my life much more convinient and easier. However, the growth of AI has undergone a wealth of criticisms and has to be considered thoroughly. Although it makes everyone’s lives easier, it tends to boarden the gap between everyone due to the lack of interactions. For example, instead of asking for store, restaurant, music reccomendations, AI assistant is there for them to ask for suggestions which can personalize based on their favors. Moreover, some digital assistants also offer home automation, which gives everyone a great chance to use the technology to control their houses such as lighting, garage door and other devices.</p>
            <h4>b)	IoT (Internet of Things)</h4>
            <p class="align-para">Throughout my project, IoT is also considered as one of the most important technologies which has a great impact on the success of my ideas. At the moment, it is getting more and more common and being applied into many utilities in daily lives. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects – devices, instruments, vehicles,… embedded with electronics, circuits, software, sensors connecting via internet. The objects are likely to be sensed and controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, bringing more direct integration of real-world issues into computer-based systems. Therefore, it would result in more accurate and efficient management as IoT allows objects to work without the intervention of human. Up to now, some preliminary IoT applications have been already developed in healthcare, transportation or automotive industries. First of all, it is necessary to state that the IoT in medical system has broadened the application prospects. Recently, IoT is built as RFID model with the aim to collect bedside sample for doctors easily. They can identify the patient’s identification and if there are some errors, the system will notice and alert the doctor automatically. Moreover, it proves to be effective in blood management which helps the hospitals avoid the shortcomings of small capacity bar codes, reduce blood contamination and improve data collection efficiency. Beside these applications, there are many sensors installed in the sickroom which can collect the conditions of the patients and transfer the data to hospital’s server. Another considerable application to indicate is the telemedicine technology which allows medical experts, doctors to consult and diagnose patient’s conditions remotely. It has brought back a great number of benefits for medical system as they can take care of a higher volume of patients and improve the access to health care. To be more specific, telemedicine offers greater reach to rural and remote areas, making it more convenient for them to make and keep appointments. As a result, it can reduce the time and cost of transporting but still be able to maintain the high-quality services. Thanks to IoT, a diverse range of medical devices and equipment can be connected to hospital’s server and make use of real-time data, which helps doctors to keep up with the patient’s conditions accurately. For example, special wearables or medical devices will be provided so as to check patient’s blood pressure, heath rate and transmit results for doctors to analyze. From my own perspective, I believe that IoT will play a crucial part in building a smart house, which is considered as one of the most intriguing changes in the future. It is firmly believed that house is the major place of many human activities, such as living or working. Many researches have been conducted in order to enhance the living places, provide better living facilities in the house. Smart house, which is also called as house automation, is applying new technology to make the household activities much more convenient, comfortable, safe and economical. In general, a smart house can automatically control the lighting, heating system, air-conditioning and door-locks,… Also, I strongly agree that this application can even develop further if there is an integration between IoT and AI. With the support from AI software, every device is likely to learn and improve its setting so as to be compatible with the owner’s personal preferences. </p>
            <p class="align-para">Similar to AI/ML, IoT has a great impact on nearly every kind of industries ranging from military service, medical system, technical perspective to business operation. One interesting part is that everybody usually assume that just scientific industries can make use of IoT but there is a report pointing out that it is also useful in business activities especially in marketing campaigns. In other words, this technology is likely to bring a new marketing trend and modify the traditional methods. IoT applications and sensors become a real factor in data collection with the aim to seek out a suitable approach attracting potential customers as well as keeping the loyalty of the existing ones. Another considerable point to mention is that IoT technology is also utilized to construct automatic systems for agriculture. One remarkable application to present is the intelligent greenhouses which include hydroponic and small-scale aquaponic systems. It also makes use of cameras in order to verify the quality of food. It is getting more and more popular in the urban areas as they allow owners to monitor and control the nutrient solutions, boost the yields and quality of plants. Another area in which IoT technologies are implemented is the vertical agriculture, which allows controlling soil moisture and water content by connecting to central devices such as computers or smartphones. Therefore, many farm workers or labors will be replaced by the IoT systems because of their efficiency and time-consuming feature. But in my opinion, IoT technology would rather appear as a convenient tool supporting varied purposes than replacing any jobs or technology. </p>
            <p class="align-para">In my daily life, if IoT applications are installed everywhere, it will provide a much more comfortable experience, especially in in-house environment thanks to the automatic control. I belive that living in a smart house is highly possible to create new habits and modify the old ones. Every switch may be abandoned as everything can be controlled via internet by getting access to the relevant monitor on one’s smartphone. A connected home not only proves to be economical and efficient but also reduces the impact on the environment. Moreover, there are some even smarter models which allow owners to use their voice in order to give orders. With the power of IoT assistants, it helps me to exlude the likelihood of memory failures such as leaving a window opened or forgetting to turn off the AC or lights. Another considerable point to notice is that IoT system can enhance the level of security and safety for individual house. One vivid example to mention is the PIR motion sensors installed at the entrance. It will detect the motion of human beings and may alert the owner by sending a voice call to warn “There is an Intruder in the House”. Similar to camera module of medical system, many sensors can be installed in each room so if there is any unexpected circumstance such as stroke or heart attack, it will call the ambulance immediately. Moreover, parents can make use of this model to look after their children when they are working. Therefore, if the kids put themselves in danger such as touching sharps object, climbing, the application will observe and send the notifications to their parents. Also, I believe this application will be excessively useful to ensure the safety for all my family members, especially my 3 young mischievous cousins and my great grandmother.</p>

            <h3>Transcript</h3>
            <p class="align-para"><span class="bold-title""> 1. First, can you introduce a little bit about yourself, your position and current company?</span>
                <br> Ok, my name is Htun Oo and I have worked in Australia for 11 years. At the moment, I am a business intelligence developer at SG Fleet company.
            </p>
            <p class="align-para"><span class="bold-title"">2. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</span>
                <br> So what I do as business intelligence is to transform the data of business into the more understandable reports or visualizations. I usually apply some query tool, data modeling tools and data visualization to get the unknown, covered information. Then I also develop program, respond to customer’s inquiries. They may ask about why this report show this information, where the data sources come from or the report schedule. 
            </p>
            <p class="align-para"><span class="bold-title"">3. Please tell us about the industry you work in. </span>
                <br> Ok so my company is a financial management company specialized in motor vehicle industry. We are a leasing company and usually work with long-term leasing about 4-5 years.
            </p>
            <p class="align-para"><span class="bold-title"">4. In your opinion, what are the most valuable skills that you learned from the university?</span>
                <br> In the past, I studied Software Engineering back in the university. So, the most important thing that I learned from the university is the logical point of view. The real-life situations are much different from the university as the university’s problems would be given with a guideline or the number of rules that we should follow. But the real-life issues are the whole different things. However, the university still trained me to work systematically. And also, my teamwork, communication skills are helpful because at the working place, I have to interact with my co-workers, my boss… So, to sum up my answer, I would say that logical thinking, organized working style and soft skills are 3 things that I appreciate the most. 
            </p>
            <p class="align-para"><span class="bold-title"">5. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them?</span>   
                <br> I have to say that I am working in in-house IT Department, I do not have to deal with the outside customers. The ones that we usually interact with is the business users. They are the people who will talk to the clients, consult and understand their demands then bring it to IT team. We will discuss about the requirements and is it able to be implemented. Another case is that business users are also the main users of the application at first so they will test and request the IT team to fix some errors or improve any functions. The purpose of it is to keep the project align with the company’s goals. I would say that business users are the co-workers that I have to work with most of the time. 
            </p>
            <p class="align-para"><span class="bold-title""> 6. Which aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these. </span>
                <br> For him, keeping up with the current technology costs him much time to research and update himself. Working in the IT industry if you do not update the knowledge everyday, you will be left behind and encounter a lot of troubles. I spend most of my day to research the data as my job is a business intelligence developer. Then after find enough sources, I will start to implement proper data models and find a way to illustrate. The main purpose is to point out the underlying, the hidden data to reveal the business’s problem.
            </p>
            <p class="align-para"><span class="bold-title">7. What aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</span>    
                <br> As I come from IT background, understanding the everchanging business flow, strategy is the most challenging part for me. IT team is seen as the support for business. Therefore, I have to understand the business logic to know how should it be transformed and to support it with innovated methods. Also, I have to ensure that this application can be used for their future plans. I would say that to become a good IT guy, keeping up with IT new technologies is a must but you also need to keep up with the changing strategies in business world.
                <br> Initially, I have to say that as I also want to become an IT professional, I have modified some questions in order to fit with my inquiries. I have an honor to have an interview with Mr. Htun Oo who has been working in IT industry for over 10 years in Australia. At the moment, he is working for SG Fleet company as a business intelligence developer. This is a link for his company’s website: <a href="https://www.sgfleet.com/au">https://www.sgfleet.com/au</a> . As a business intelligence developer, his main job is to transform the data understandable for business, develop program, respond to customer’s inquiries. He also mentions that the inquiries mainly revolve around the reason behind one specific data or where the data sources come from or the report schedule progress. However, he does not directly contact with the clients but via a business department. Moreover, he firmly stated that the ultimate vision of his role is to gain a deeper insight into busniess’s problems and provide information for better business decision making. It takes him a great deal of time to do research and plan solutions for one existing problem from a client. About the industry that he is involved in, his company is a fleet management, leasing company specialized in motor vehicle industry. Long-term vehicles leasing is mentioned as one of the most common services of SG Fleet. Talking about the skills that he has to apply apart from academic performance, he points out that the logical point of view is the most valuable trait that he learned from the university. Although university’s situations are much different from the real-life ones, it still trained the organized, systematic problem-solving approach. In other words, in order to achieve the final result, there is a guidline, a number of rules that everyone should follow. Moreover, acquiring soft skills such as proper communintion, teamwork spirit as in the business setting, he has to interact with different people namely co-workers, manager, department head. To be more specific, instead of using IT terms, he has to utilize common terms to explain the technical aspects in order to make it understandable for business users. In conclusion, logical thinking, systematic working style, social skills should be deemed as 3 important skills from his point of view. As he is working at in-house IT department, dealing with outside customers is not his businiess. Instead, there are business users who are responsible for dealing with customers in order to understand their requests then transmit the ideas to IT team. At that point, they will have a dicussion whether those ideas are able to be implemented or not. Moreover, as the business users are the ones who will experience and test out the application initially, they will report any spotted errors with the aim to improve the quality and keep the project align with the company’s goal, plan. From his own experience, keeping up with the current technology costs him much time as the novelties keep popping up everyday. Also, it is well-known that STEM industry has been always changing at the startling pace and the quick adaption is a must. If individuals insist on using the old methods, they will be eliminated and hard to continue their jobs . Eventually, the aspect that he finds the most challenging is to understand the ever-changing business flow, strategy. As his background is IT, he encounters many obstacles to acquire business ideas thoroughly. Understanding business logic, figuring out how should a business transfom and supporting business with innovative methods are some of the aspects that he finds complexed and tough. It stems from the fact that the stategies in the business world always change and the supportive IT team has to implement the system that aligns with their present and also future plans. At the end of the interview, he emphasizes that IT workers not only need to keep up with the modern technology but also have to notice about business ideas with the aim to support the clients as effectively as possible.
